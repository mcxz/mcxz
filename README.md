## What is MCXZ?

MCXZ(which means 挖矿与修真 in Chinese) is a mod written for the very popular sandbox game [Minecraft](https://minecraft.net/). It is built on top of the [Minecraft Forge](https://github.com/MinecraftForge) API.

It tries to expand and improve the original Minecraft greatly by adding many new systems, blocks, entities, and features about the ancient Chinese's myth and fable.

It's still in early development, and currently maintained by [zlainsama](https://github.com/zlainsama).
